# PHP Array Sum Function Bug

This repository demonstrates a bug in a PHP function designed to calculate the sum of numbers within an array. The function works correctly with numeric arrays and empty arrays. However, when non-numeric values are present, the function does not throw an error but instead produces an unexpected sum.
